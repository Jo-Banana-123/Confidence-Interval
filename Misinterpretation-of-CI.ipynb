    "⚠️ Common Misinterpretations of Confidence Intervals (CI)\n",
    "❌ 1. “There’s a 95% probability that the true mean is inside this interval.”\n",
    "✅ Correction:\n",
    "The true mean is a fixed value — it's either inside or outside the interval.\n",
    "A 95% CI means that if you repeated the experiment 100 times, about 95 intervals would contain the true mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ The confidence is in the method, not in a single interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ 2. “The sample mean is always at the center of the confidence interval.”\n",
    "✅ Correction:\n",
    "Only true for symmetric intervals like those from t- or z-distributions.\n",
    "For asymmetric intervals (e.g., from bootstrapping), the sample mean may not be centered.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ 3. “95% of the data fall inside the 95% confidence interval.”\n",
    "✅ Correction:\n",
    "The CI is about the uncertainty of a statistic (like the mean), not the spread of raw data.\n",
    "Individual data points can lie far outside the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "CI ≠ data range\n",
    "CI = range for the estimated parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ 4. “Once calculated, there’s a 95% chance the true mean is in this interval.”\n",
    "✅ Correction:\n",
    "After computing the CI, there's no probability left — the interval either contains the true value or not.\n",
    "The 95% refers to the success rate of the procedure over repeated sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ 5. “A wider CI means my estimate is more accurate.”\n",
    "✅ Correction:\n",
    "A narrower CI usually reflects greater precision (e.g., larger sample size).\n",
    "A wider CI can mean more uncertainty, not better accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy = how close to the true value\n",
    "Precision = how tight the estimate range is\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Recommended Interpretation\n",
    "“We used a method that gives correct intervals 95% of the time.\n",
    "Based on our sample, we estimate that the true population mean lies between A and B.”"
